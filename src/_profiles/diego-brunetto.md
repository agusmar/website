# 🛠 Skills

## 💻 Technology

### Javascript ⭐️

My "native" programming language, I've worked with it for over a year. I've used it in the front-end with React and Redux, and for testing using Jest.

### React Js ⚛️

My go-to library for frontend applications. I focus on learning the whole ecosistem.

### Redux ☢️

I learned how to manage state using tools like sagas, reselect, and redux toolkit.

### Next Js 🔼

Probably the most exciting thing I have learned in the last months. I'm currently doing a personal blog.

### SASS 🎨

I think this is the most effective way to code my css, with scalability in mind.

### CSS 💅

I love it. Currently doing some projects with the css-in-js approach, using tools like styles components and tailwind css.

### Jest 🃏 💨

You have to test, right?
